# Glycogen Metabolism Study Guide

## Quick Reference Table

| Process        | Function             | Key Enzymes            | Regulation                |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Glycogenesis   | Builds glycogen      | Glycogen synthase      | (+) Insulin               |
| Glycogenolysis | Breaks down glycogen | Glycogen phosphorylase | (+) Glucagon, Epinephrine |

## Key Processes

### Glycogenesis (Remember as "BUILD")

- **B**ranching enzyme connects chains
- **U**ses UDP-glucose
- **I**nsulin activates
- **L**inks are α-1,4 and α-1,6
- **D**one in liver and muscle

### Glycogenolysis (Remember as "BREAK")

- **B**reaks glycogen down
- **R**eleases glucose-1-phosphate
- **E**pinephrine activates
- **A**MP also activates
- **K**ey in exercise/fasting

## Enzyme Details

1. **Glycogen Synthase**:

   - Creates α-1,4 glycosidic bonds
   - Activated by insulin
   - Key in liver and muscles
   - Uses UDP-glucose as substrate

2. **Branching Enzyme**:

   - Creates α-1,6 glycosidic bonds
   - Makes branch points
   - Increases glycogen solubility
   - Enhances rapid glucose access

3. **Glycogen Phosphorylase**:

   - Breaks α-1,4 bonds
   - Activated by:
     - Glucagon
     - Epinephrine
     - AMP
   - Key in glucose mobilization

4. **Debranching Enzyme**:
   - Removes branch points
   - Works with phosphorylase
   - Two enzymatic activities
   - Essential for complete breakdown

## Hormonal Control

### Insulin (Storage Signal)

- Promotes glycogenesis
- Inhibits glycogenolysis
- Active in fed state
- Targets liver and muscle

### Glucagon (Breakdown Signal)

- Promotes glycogenolysis
- Inhibits glycogenesis
- Active in fasting
- Primarily targets liver

## Practice Questions

1. What activates glycogen synthase?
2. How are branch points formed?
3. What hormone promotes glycogen breakdown?
4. Where does glycogen storage mainly occur?
5. What's the difference between α-1,4 and α-1,6 bonds?

## Common Exam Topics

- [ ] Enzyme mechanisms
- [ ] Hormonal regulation
- [ ] Storage locations
- [ ] Metabolic disorders
- [ ] Energy state effects

## Clinical Connections

1. **Glycogen Storage Diseases**:

   - von Gierke's disease
   - Pompe disease
   - McArdle's disease

2. **Diabetes Effects**:
   - Impaired glycogen storage
   - Altered hormone responses
   - Metabolic complications

## Study Tips

1. **Remember the Opposites**:

   - Synthesis vs. Breakdown
   - Insulin vs. Glucagon
   - Fed vs. Fasting
   - α-1,4 vs. α-1,6 bonds

2. **Visualize the Structure**:

   - Tree-like branching
   - Main chain with branches
   - Glucose units as building blocks

3. **Understand the Logic**:
   - Storage when energy abundant
   - Breakdown when energy needed
   - Tissue-specific regulation
