## Metabolic States in Detail

### 1. Fed State (Remember as "GAIN")

- **G**lucose uptake increased
- **A**nabolic processes dominate
- **I**nsulin secretion high
- **N**utrient storage activated

#### Key Features:

- High insulin/low glucagon
- Glycogen synthesis
- Protein synthesis
- Lipogenesis
- Glucose oxidation

### 2. Fasting State (Remember as "FAST")

- **F**at mobilization begins
- **A**mino acids preserved
- **S**ugar levels maintained
- **T**issue-specific adaptations

#### Key Features:

- Low insulin/high glucagon
- Glycogenolysis
- Gluconeogenesis
- Increased lipolysis
- Protein sparing

### 3. Starvation State (Remember as "SPARE")

- **S**paring protein
- **P**rotecting brain
- **A**dapting metabolism
- **R**educing energy use
- **E**nhancing ketone use

#### Key Features:

- Minimal insulin
- High glucagon
- Ketone production
- Protein conservation
- Reduced metabolic rate

## Tissue-Specific Metabolism

### Liver

- Fed: Glucose → Glycogen
- Fasting: Glycogen → Glucose
- Starvation: Amino acids → Glucose

### Muscle

- Fed: Amino acid uptake
- Fasting: Protein breakdown
- Starvation: Protein conservation

### Adipose

- Fed: Glucose → Triglycerides
- Fasting: Triglycerides → Fatty acids
- Starvation: Maximum lipolysis

### Brain

- Fed: Glucose only
- Fasting: Mainly glucose
- Starvation: Glucose + ketones

## Hormonal Control

### Insulin Effects:

1. **Anabolic**:

   - Promotes glucose uptake
   - Stimulates glycogen synthesis
   - Increases protein synthesis
   - Enhances lipogenesis

2. **Anti-catabolic**:
   - Inhibits glycogenolysis
   - Reduces gluconeogenesis
   - Decreases lipolysis

### Glucagon Effects:

1. **Catabolic**:

   - Promotes glycogenolysis
   - Stimulates gluconeogenesis
   - Increases lipolysis

2. **Anti-anabolic**:
   - Reduces glycogen synthesis
   - Decreases lipogenesis

## Practice Questions

1. What characterizes the fed state?
2. How does metabolism change during fasting?
3. Why do ketone bodies increase in starvation?
4. How does the brain adapt to starvation?
5. What triggers the switch between states?
