## Key Points to Remember

1. **Location**: Takes place in mitochondrial matrix
2. **Purpose**:

   - Oxidize acetyl-CoA to CO₂
   - Generate high-energy electron carriers (NADH and FADH₂)
   - Produce GTP

3. **Regulation Points**:

   - Pyruvate Dehydrogenase:
     - (+) Insulin
     - (-) Acetyl-CoA

4. **Products per cycle**:
   - 2 CO₂
   - 6 NADH
   - 2 FADH₂
   - 2 ATP/GTP

## Practice Questions

1. Where does the Citric Acid Cycle occur?
2. What activates Pyruvate Dehydrogenase?
3. Name three products of the Citric Acid Cycle.
4. What is the first step in the cycle?
5. How many NADH molecules are produced per cycle?

## Common Exam Topics

- [ ] Cycle location and purpose
- [ ] Step-by-step reactions
- [ ] Energy yields
- [ ] Regulatory mechanisms
- [ ] Connection to other metabolic pathways

## Additional Notes

- The cycle is also known as the Krebs Cycle or TCA Cycle
- It's a central hub of metabolism
- Links carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism
- Key regulatory points occur at irreversible steps
