| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Lipid Transport        | Chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, HDL | Transport lipids in blood | Different densities and directions |
| Cholesterol Metabolism | HMG-CoA reductase            | Synthesis and regulation  | Dietary and synthesized sources    |
| Protein Catabolism     | Amino acid degradation       | Energy production         | Occurs in small intestine          |

## Lipid Transport System

### Transport Vehicles (Remember as "CVLH")

```
Chylomicrons → VLDL → LDL → HDL
(Increasing density →)
```

### Functions:

1. **Chylomicrons**:

   - Transport dietary lipids
   - From intestine to tissues
   - Lowest density

2. **VLDL** (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein):

   - Transport endogenous lipids
   - From liver to tissues
   - Low density

3. **LDL** (Low-Density Lipoprotein):

   - "Bad cholesterol"
   - Delivers cholesterol to tissues
   - Medium density

4. **HDL** (High-Density Lipoprotein):
   - "Good cholesterol"
   - Returns cholesterol to liver
   - Highest density

## Cholesterol Metabolism

### Key Points (Remember as "DASH"):

- **D**ietary sources
- **A**cetyl-CoA synthesis
- **S**tatins target HMG-CoA reductase
- **H**MG-CoA reductase is rate-limiting

### Synthesis Pathway:

```
Acetyl-CoA → HMG-CoA → Mevalonate → Cholesterol
              ↑
        Rate-limiting step
        (HMG-CoA reductase)
```

### Regulation:

1. **Dietary Intake**:

   - Feedback inhibition
   - Reduces synthesis

2. **HMG-CoA Reductase**:
   - Key regulatory enzyme
   - Target of statin drugs
   - Controlled by:
     - Hormones
     - Dietary cholesterol
     - Cell cholesterol levels

## Fatty Acid Metabolism

### Palmitic Acid Synthesis:

- Occurs in cytoplasm
- From acetyl-CoA
- Only fatty acid humans synthesize

### β-oxidation:

- Occurs in mitochondria
- Uses carnitine shuttle
- Produces acetyl-CoA
- Energy-yielding process

### Ketone Bodies:

- Formed during starvation
- Alternative energy source
- Used by peripheral tissues
- From excess acetyl-CoA

## Protein Catabolism

### Location:

- Primary: Small intestine
- Secondary: Liver

### Process:

1. Protein digestion
2. Amino acid absorption
3. Carbon skeleton use
4. Urea cycle disposal

### Uses of Amino Acids:

- Gluconeogenesis
- Energy production
- Protein synthesis
- Urea formation

## Practice Questions

1. What's the difference between VLDL and LDL?
2. How is cholesterol synthesis regulated?
3. What is the role of carnitine shuttle?
4. Where does protein digestion primarily occur?
5. What are ketone bodies used for?
